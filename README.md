I'm a Linux systems engineer and developer with a strong passion for
automation, back-end tooling, and infrastructure.  

I specialize in:

- Writing minimal, functional, dependency-free Bash scripts, and (if I must) POSIX 
  shell scripts  
- Building infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration as code (CaC) with Ansible
- Managing servers and self-hosted services in my homelab (Proxmox + K8s)
- Documenting everything using Markdown/[MkDocs](https://notes.kolkhis.dev) and GitHub Pages  
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions

I'm currently working towards a career in **DevOps/Platform Engineering**, and I love
helping others learn the command line and Linux systems from the ground up.
